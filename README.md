This repo contains two submodules, one with the client and the other with the server:

```
➜  fullstack-graphql-vue git:(main) ✗ git submodule foreach 'git remote -v' | grep 'origin.*fetch'
origin  git@github.com:crguezl/client-graphql-vue-hello.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:crguezl/server-graphql-hello.git (fetch)
```
* [Server Repo](https://github.com/crguezl/server-graphql-hello)
* [Client Repo](https://github.com/crguezl/client-graphql-vue-hello/tree/main)

In the branch `solution` of each of those repos you will find the solution to this lab.
